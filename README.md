📸 IDSnap – Photo-Based Identity Lookup System
IDSnap is an AI-powered identification system that recognizes a person from a photo and retrieves detailed information about them. It uses facial embeddings, a vector similarity search engine, and a metadata database to enable secure and accurate person lookup. Ideal for use cases like military attendance, school check-ins, corporate access control, or visitor registration.

🚀 Features
🧠 Face embedding and recognition using deep learning.

📦 Vector database (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone) to store and search facial representations.

🗂️ Relational/NoSQL database to store personal information.

📤 Image upload interface (or real-time webcam support).

🔍 Instant identity lookup and data display.

🔐 Secure access and data handling.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Backend Python, Flask or FastAPI
Face Embedding DeepFace / dlib / InsightFace
Vector Database FAISS / Pinecone / Weaviate

🔧 Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repo
   bash
   Copy
   Edit
   git clone https://github.com/saidabroor/IDSnap.git
   cd IDSnap
2. Install Dependencies
   bash
   Copy
   Edit
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and dlib prerequisites installed.

3. Start the Backend
   bash
   Copy
   Edit
   python app/main.py
   Or use uvicorn if using FastAPI.

4. (Optional) Run Frontend
   You can serve the frontend using Bolt AI, React, or a basic HTML template.

🧪 API Endpoints
Method Endpoint Description
POST /upload_photo Uploads a face photo
GET /get_info/{id} Returns user details by ID
POST /add_person Add a new person + vector

📚 Example Use Case: Military Attendance
A soldier stands in front of a camera or uploads a selfie.

The system generates an embedding and finds the closest match.

The system returns:

Name

ID Number

Status (e.g., enlisted / discharged)

Last Seen

Assigned Unit

✅ To-Do / Roadmap
Add real-time webcam face detection

Add user authentication for admins

Add support for multiple faces in one photo

Improve embedding matching threshold logic

Deploy to cloud (Render, Vercel, etc.)

⚠️ Security Notes
All embeddings are stored securely, not raw images.

API access should be restricted via authentication.

Sensitive data should be encrypted at rest and in transit.

🧠 Inspiration
This system is inspired by practical real-world needs like:

Military or school attendance automation

Employee/visitor face check-in

Fast identity verification with minimal interaction
